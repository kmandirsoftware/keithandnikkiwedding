    <h2>DIA</h2>
    <p>
        The best airport to fly into is <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?q=Denver+International+Airport"><b>Denver International (DIA)</b></a>. The drive from DIA to Cherry Creek is a little less than half an hour (30 miles). 
    </p>

    <h2>Light Rail from DIA to Cherry Creek</h2>
    <p>
        For those of you who are sharing cars, but who may not be arriving at the airport at the same time, there's the <a href="https://www.denver.org/about-denver/transportation/airport-rail/"><b>DIA Light Rail</b></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new Denver airport rail has six stops between the airport and Denver Union Station. The ride takes about 37 minutes.  The rates are $9 for one person each way.
